### Bubble Sort

[Wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bubble_sort)

One of the easier to implement sorting algorithms, Bubble Sort works by
"bubbling" the largest numbers to the end of the array. In order to accomplish
this the computer will look at two adjacent numbers in the array and if
the numbers are out of order they are swapped with one another.

Bubble sort's complexity is _O_(nÂ²) which does make it quite slow compared
to the other sorting algorithms.

Wiki:
> The only significant advantage that bubble sort has over most other implementations, even quicksort, but not insertion sort, is that the ability to detect that the list is sorted efficiently is built into the algorithm. When the list is already sorted (best-case), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n).
